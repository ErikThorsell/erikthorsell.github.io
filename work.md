# Work #

Even though I have yet to leave the comfort of school, I am not without work
experience.
I have spent summers working different jobs as well as extra jobs while
studying.
Below are some short descriptions of the jobs I have held.

### Flower Entrepreneur ###

As my very first job, my grandparents would drive me to the town square and I
would sell flowers from their garden.
At the time I was not older than 10 years old.
I sold perennial flowers (mostly different primulas) but my favorite was the
[stemless gentian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/GentianaAcaulisRannoch.jpg)!

I did not think much of this job when I was young, but almost twenty years later
I think it was really cool that my grandparents let me do this and I really
think it helped me in developing my communications skills and ability to *sell*.


### Go-kart Track ###

When I turned 18 I was quick to get a drivers license, and with said license
came the opportunity to work further away from home.
I was in to competitive go-karting when I was young and for two summers I was
responsible for the rental operation at my local track.
This entailed everything from taking care of the cars and customers, to handling
the money and facilities.

The owner would drop by to pick up the money from the register after closing,
and if something was very wrong with one of the cars he would fix that, but
apart from that I ran the place.
The most important thing I learned during these two summers were costumer care.
It was really satisfying when recurring costumers came back and said that they
had a blast last time they were at the track!
