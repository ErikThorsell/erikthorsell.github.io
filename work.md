# Work #

Even though I have yet to leave the comfort of school, I am not without work
experience.
I have spent summers working different jobs as well as part time jobs while
studying.
Below are descriptions of some of the jobs I have held.

### Flower Entrepreneur ###

As my very first job, my grandparents would drive me to the town square and I
would sell flowers from their garden.
At the time I was not older than 10 years old.
I sold perennial flowers (mostly different primulas) but my favorite was the
[stemless gentian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/GentianaAcaulisRannoch.jpg)!

I did not think much of this job when I was young, but almost twenty years later
I think it was really cool that my grandparents let me do this and I really
think it helped me in developing my communications skills and ability to *sell*.


### Junior Journalist ###

The newspaper in my hometown had a *junior editorial staff* that employed people
between ages 17 and 19 (gymnasiestudenter).
I spent two years working there.
We had meetings every Monday and our group of nine would sit down and discuss
what ideas we had and what we should do.
Every Monday we would have the centerfold of the newspaper and we did some
really fascinating stories.
For instance an undercover article about child grooming, an interview with the
youngest member of the Swedish Parliament and the yearly (ever so anticipated)
ice cream test!

I was best known for my chronicles that often concerned some social injustice or
other (for a 17 year old) insightful thought.
The chronicles were often provocative and were seldom left without criticism.
My time at the newspaper taught me how to phrase myself, to take criticism and
to be thorough; it is not fun to begin next weeks centerfold with correcting
last week's piece.


### Go-kart Track Manager ###

When I turned 18 I was quick to get a drivers license, and with said license
came the opportunity to work further away from home.
I was in to competitive go-karting when I was young and for two summers I was
responsible for the rental operation at my local track.
This entailed everything from taking care of the cars and customers, to handling
the money and facilities.

The owner would drop by to pick up the money from the register after closing,
and if something was very wrong with one of the cars he would fix that, but
apart from that I ran the place.
The most important thing I learned during these two summers were costumer care.
It was really satisfying when recurring costumers came back and said that they
had a blast last time they were at the track!
