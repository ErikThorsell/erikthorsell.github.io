# Blog #

I used to work as a junior journalist and I blogged for almost 10 years. If I
feel the urge to write something down (most likely it will be something nerdy
about computers or it might just be photos), you'll find it below.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
