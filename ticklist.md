*Climbed routes, maybe a comment, and occasionally a photo.*


### Fjällbo, Kenneths led ###

**Date:** 2018-06-10

A good route. I don't think it deserves the 3 stars in the guide book but a good
route nevertheless. Really easy climb for being a 5.

**Gear:** Two large cams and a nut up to the tree, sling the tree and nuts after
the tree.

**Anchor:** Bolted

---

### Utby, Till ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Nice route on the cliff with the same name. Best done as a transport to the
route *Luftiga Steget* (i.e. climb until the plateaux, regroup, and change
line).

**Gear:** *Not sure but,* a size 2 and a size 3 cam, nuts and maybe a size 0.75
cam at the end.

**Anchor:** Excellent tree on the plateaux!

---

### Utby, Luftiga Steget ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Such a good route. Exposed. The line scaling the cliff face is even better but a
bit too exposed at the moment.

**Gear:** Apart from one or two size 2 or 3 cams at the beginning of the route,
you only need nuts.

**Anchor:** If finished to the right, trees, if finished to the left, a 0.75 cam
and either a quite large or a quite small nut.

---

### Utby, Alfa Helix ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

*not done*

Starts of to the right of the big crack/opening. (Early pro will likely result
in severe rope drag.) Difficult to put pro around the crux.

**Gear:** Cam 2 in horizontal crack as first protection, one nut and maybe a
small cam before the tree. Sling the tree as final pro. 

**Anchor:** There is a bolted anchor to repel from, but for belaying your
second I would use the tree in the corner of the plateaux.

---

### Gärdsås, Jug ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Nice route with two alternatives for the middle. All parts are easily protected.

**Gear:** A little bit of each. Nice to have a size 2 cam behind the big block.

**Anchor:** A tree and maybe a cam backup.

---

### Gärdsås, Luftmadrassen-ish ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Climbed the route but instead of traversing the second roof to Älgens
Överraskning I went straight up. Really nice route nevertheless!

**Gear:** Quite long route (uses a lot of gear). I used sizes 0.5, 0.75, 1, and
2, but would have been nice with some more smaller cams. Placed quite a lot of
nuts but only a couple felt bomber.

**Anchor:** A juniper and two cams (size 3 and size 4) made a nice three point
anchor.

---

### Gärdsås, Älgens Överraskning ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Such a nice route.

**Gear:** Used a full Friend rack, except the 4. Could have used at least one
(preferably two) more size 1 for the traverse (did it with only a bomber nut in
the dihedral, that was intense...). Some nice nuts overall, but mostly vertical
cracks.

**Anchor:** Juniper and a size 4 cam.

---

### Utby, La Triviata ###

**Date:** 2018-06-26

A 4+, and as is common with routes graded 4 in Utby it is weird. Not bad, not
good.

**Gear:** Do not remember.

**Anchor:** Tree, quite far in, backed up with a \#3 Friend.

---

### Utby, Rönnleden ###

**Date:** 2018-06-26

A rare, very nice, 4+ route. In the guide book it is declared a really good
beginners route. I would agree, but building the anchor might be a bit tricky.

**Gear:** A few nuts and I think I placed a \#1 Friend. 

**Anchor:** \#2 and \#.75 Friends, yet the anchor was still a bit too low for my
taste.

---

### Utby, Ragnhilds Näsa ###

**Date:** 2018-06-26

*Not done*

First good placement I found was on the actual nose (5m up).
It might be possible to place something in the first horizontal crack, but I
could not find anything.
I fell after placing my first piece, but before being able to mantle onto the
nose.
After a rest and securing my cam with a nut, I was able to proceed to the wall
climbing part, but with only an additional \#2 in the big horizontal crack I did
not feel safe proceeding up the slab.
It is probably fine to take a fall there, but I'll probably TR this one before I
give it another try.

**Gear:** \#.5 in the nose, backed up with a small nut. \#2 in the horizontal
after the nose.

**Anchor:** *N/A*

---

### Utby,  Asterik och Obelix ###

**Date:** 2018-07-06

Dihedron that offers som really nice stemming and crack climbing.

**Gear:** \#.5, \#.75, and \#1 Friends. Finished of with a sling around the
tree.

**Anchor:** I did not belay my second from the top, but he opted to TR the route
from the birch.

---

### Fjällbo, Gunnars Skräck ###

**Date:** 2018-07-15

A really nice slab, sort of in a dihedron.

**Gear:** Some really nice nuts and maybe a \#1 friend.

**Anchor:** Bolted if you do only the first part.

---

### Fjällbo, Skivblocket ###

**Date:** 2018-07-15

Spectacular piece of rock just standing there. Quite exposed and serious.

**Gear:** \#.75 friend and one bolt. 

**Anchor:** Bolted

---

### Fjällbo, ? ###

**Date:** 2018-07-15

A short crack. If you traverse to the right and then continue up the route is
called Limus. We did not know this and went straight up (significantly easier).

**Gear:** \#.5, \#.75, (\#1) friends, one big (13/14) nut in the upper section.

**Anchor:** If you have duplicates of small cams, you can use these. I had to
run into to the woods and find a tree...

---

### Fjällbo, Chivas Regal ###

**Date:** 2018-07-19

Nice crack, with a mini traverse on a good ledge. Crack climbing that does not
require jamming.

**Gear:** A lot. Used a full set of friends (minus the \#4) and 4 or 5 nuts.

**Anchor:** Trees. So many good trees.

---

### Fjällbo, Koskenkorva ###

**Date:** 2018-07-19

Crack to the right of the previous route that has given name to the crag. Not as
nice as Chivas regal.

**Gear:** A lot of cams and nuts.

**Anchor:** Trees. So many good trees.

---

### Fjällbo, Drambuie ###

**Date:** 2018-07-19

First 5+ on-sight. Committing start, but not very difficult.

**Gear:** \#.5 - \#1 and a \#3 friends, + a lot of nuts.

**Anchor:** Trees. So many good trees.

---

### Gärdsås, Mowgli ###

**Date:** 2018-07-31

Nice, shorter, route well in the shades on a very warm day.

**Gear:** One 14 nut, and basically a set of friends. (Might have omitted the
\#.75.)

**Anchor:** A very big tree

---

### Utby, Skärselden ###

**Date:** 2018-08-04

Crack climbing, but not very difficult. Nice route!

**Gear:** A diverse rack is good.

**Anchor:** Two medium sized nuts. Also trees available a bit further from the
edge.

---

### Utby, Slabben ###

**Date:** 2018-08-04

Basically a huge block that forms a nice slab. You can see a video of my friend
climbing it [HERE](https://youtu.be/7xD2swL0-vg).

**Gear:** Two nuts and a cam!

**Anchor:** Nope. We simply jumped off at the end.

---

### Utby, Spagaten ###

**Date:** 2018-08-04

Such. A. Good. Route.

I have probably climbed this route 10 times, but never on lead. The experience
is so much more intense when leading it. Despite being very familiar with the
route I went of the route a little bit (started doing the "direct" version,
bumps the grade up one notch to a 6-) and had to down climb two moves. Ugh.
Pulled myself together and finished the route. Intense!

**Gear:** A lot of really nice nuts, but some cams are nice to have (\#1 and
\#2).

**Anchor:** There's a big block you can put a sling around. Also some bomber nut
placements and if you have \#.5 and \#.75 cams there are good placements for
those too.

---

### Utby, Torrsimmet ###

**Date:** 2018-08-04

Intense climbing that requires some really cool body jams. Spectacular body roll
move at the end if one wants to avoid belly flopping your way up the last part.

**Gear:** Definately requires big gear (used \#3 and \#4, could easily have used
another of each). Some good nuts.

**Anchor:** Sling around a big rock and a nut in the wall did the trick.

---

### Utby, Laybacksprickan ###

**Date:** 2018-09-19

Quite nice crack that offers one or two good layback moves.

**Gear:** Small cams. Used 1/2 Alien Revo, 2x.5 Friends, and a couple of small
nuts.

**Anchor:** 240 sling around a tree.

---

### Utby, Mirceas Led ###

**Date:** 2018-09-19

A wonderful, but oh so short, finger crack. A bit tricky to get up onto, but
offers solid crack climbing for 8 meters. [Video can be found here.](https://youtu.be/AJIaAwqW3xA)

**Gear:** Mostly nuts, but a .5 Friend (or x4 in this case) was good to have.

**Anchor:** 240 sling around a tree.
