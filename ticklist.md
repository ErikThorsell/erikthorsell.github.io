*Climbed routes, maybe a comment, and occasionally a photo.*


### Fjällbo, Kenneths led ###

**Date:** 2018-06-10

A good route. I don't think it deserves the 3 stars in the guide book but a good
route nevertheless. Really easy climb for being a 5.

**Gear:** Two large cams and a nut up to the tree, sling the tree and nuts after
the tree.

**Anchor:** Bolted

---

### Utby, Till ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Nice route on the cliff with the same name. Best done as a transport to the
route *Luftiga Steget* (i.e. climb until the plateaux, regroup, and change
line).

**Gear:** *Not sure but,* a size 2 and a size 3 cam, nuts and maybe a size 0.75
cam at the end.

**Anchor:** Excellent tree on the plateaux!

### Utby, Luftiga Steget ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Such a good route. Exposed. The line scaling the cliff face is even better but a
bit too exposed at the moment.

**Gear:** Apart from one or two size 2 or 3 cams at the beginning of the route,
you only need nuts.

**Anchor:** If finished to the right, trees, if finished to the left, a 0.75 cam
and either a quite large or a quite small nut.

### Utby, Alfa Helix ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

*not done*

Starts of to the right of the big crack/opening. (Early pro will likely result
in severe rope drag.) Difficult to put pro around the crux.

**Gear:** Cam 2 in horizontal crack as first protection, one nut and maybe a
small cam before the tree. Sling the tree as final pro. 

**Anchor:** There is a bolted anchor to repel from, but for belaying your
second I would use the tree in the corner of the plateaux.

### Gärdsås, Jug ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Nice route with two alternatives for the middle. All parts are easily protected.

**Gear:** A little bit of each. Nice to have a size 2 cam behind the big block.

**Anchor:** A tree and maybe a cam backup.

---

### Gärdsås, Luftmadrassen-ish ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Climbed the route but instead of traversing the second roof to Älgens
Överraskning I went straight up. Really nice route nevertheless!

**Gear:** Quite long route (uses a lot of gear). I used sizes 0.5, 0.75, and 1.
Would have been nice with some more smaller cams. Placed quite a lot of nuts but
only a couple felt bomber.

**Anchor:** A juniper and two cams (size 3 and size 4) made a nice three point
anchor.

---

### Gärdsås, Älgens Överraskning ###

**Date:** 2018-06-16

Such a nice route.

**Gear:** Used a full Friend rack, except the 4. Could have used at least one
(preferably two) more size 1 for the traverse (did it with only a bomber nut in
the dihedral, that was intense...). Some nice nuts overall, but mostly vertical
cracks.

**Anchor:** Juniper and a size 4 cam.
