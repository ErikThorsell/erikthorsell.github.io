### Fj√§llbo, Kenneths led ###

**Date:** 2018-06-10

A good route. I don't think it deserves the 3 stars in the guide book but a good
route nevertheless. Really easy climb for being a 5.

**Gear:** Two large cams and a nut up to the tree, sling the tree and nuts after
the tree.

**Anchor:** Bolted

### Utby, Till ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Nice route on the cliff with the same name. Best done as a transport to the
route *Luftiga Steget* (i.e. climb until the plateaux, regroup, and change
line).

**Gear:** *Not sure but,* a size 2 and a size 3 cam, nuts and maybe a size 0.75
cam at the end.

**Anchor:** Excellent tree on the plateaux!

### Utby, Luftiga Steget ###

**Date:** 2018-06-13

Such a good route. Exposed. The line scaling the cliff face is even better but a
bit too exposed at the moment.

**Gear:** Apart from one or two size 2 or 3 cams at the beginning of the route,
you only need nuts.

**Anchor:** If finished to the right, trees, if finished to the left, a 0.75 cam
and either a quite large or a quite small nut.
