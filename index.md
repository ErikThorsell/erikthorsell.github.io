title: "Automate Everything"

DevOps enthusiast that see the opportunity to automate everything.
Because I believe DevOps will do to software development, what Lean did to
manufacturing.

## The elevator pitch

I have been fascinated by automation for as long as I can remember.
Ultimately automation comes down to doing less work, and who is not interested
in freeing up time for other tasks?[^auto]
In technology, automation often boils down to codifying knowledge and setting up
triggers that execute the correct automation task at appropriate times.
Automation free up developers to focus on creating new features, solve cool
problems, and ultimately win the marketplace.
I will go as far as to say that if you do *not* strive for increasing automation
in your organization, you will lose the marketplace.

If this resonates with you, get in touch and let's [discuss how we can work
together](/work-with-me/).

[^auto]: Naturally, these new tasks should also be evaluated as candidates for automation 😉
