# An Introduction #

My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resume as a point of contact between you and me.
The idea is that this site may act as a springboard to relevant information
about my persona.
If you found this site through *other* means but my resume, [here is the
resume]({{site.url}}/download/erikthorsell_cv.pdf).

So, let's begin.

# Current Status #

I am currently doing my master's thesis at Volvo Cars.
The topic of the thesis is: `Route pattern identification without spatial
information` and concerns the possibility to utilize machine learning to predict
speed- and energy-profiles of Volvo's cars without using GPS information. 
In short, I'm attempting to do multivariate time-series forecasting using neural
networks.

My thesis is to be done late May/early June 2018

# Coming Up #

When I have completed my thesis I will be looking for an opportunity to solve
problems.
I see myself as a very social and skilled problem solver, who has chosen
`programming` as my tool to tackle most problems I encounter.
I am, however, *not* a programm*er* in the sense that I live and breathe code.
If you are a recruiter and you are looking for your next Java/.NET-full stack
developer I am not your guy.
If you are a recruiter and you are looking for someone to help you (or your
customers):

 * determine whether it would be profitable to switch to system/framework `X`,
   and you are in need of someone to evaluate/learn/test/teach said system.
 * analyse your (customer's?) data and help you find interesting features such
   as: correlations between purchasing factors, or the optimum relation between
   buying, selling and producing some (all) of your product(s).
 * understand the possibilities (and drawbacks) of *sprinkling AI, machine
   learning and block chains* on top of your company for increased coolness.
 * *I think you get the point...*

I am your man!
I love analysing and solving complex problems and I am not intimidated by
problems that might seem too big or too difficult.
