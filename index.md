# An Introduction #

My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resumé as a point of contact between you and me. The idea is that this site may
act as a springboard to relevant information about my persona. If you found this
site through other means *but* my resumé, [here is the
resumé]({{site.url}}/download/erikthorsell_cv.pdf).

So, let's begin.


# Who am I, and what do I do? #

The spring of 2016 I acquired my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering and I
am currently pursuing my MSc in [Computer Science, Algorithm's, Languages and
Logic](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Computer-Science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx)
at Chalmers University of Technology. I have chosen to target my degree at
`Machine Learning`, `Artificial Intelligence` and the ethics surrounding these
fields.

Before I started my master's studies I spent a summer working for NASA at the
Goddard Space Flight Center. (You can find mine, and my comrades, work
[here](https://github.com/ErikThorsell/GSFC_Internship/).) During the first
year of my master I also worked part time at [NEVS](https://www.nevs.com/en/)
as an engineer (I did all sorts of stuff, hence the ambiguous title, but mostly
Matlab and LaTeX). The summer of 2017 I hold an internship at Volvo Cars, as
part of their [VESC
Programme](http://www.volvocars.com/intl/about/our-company/careers/students).

When I don't do anything related to neither school nor work I am responsible
for the music/worship in my church and my free time is spent climbing with my
fiancé, fiddling with (breaking...) my computers and reading [XKCD
comics](https://xkcd.com/1787/) (yes, I use dvorak, the [Svorak
A5-layout](http://aoeu.info/s/dvorak/images/svorak-A5.png)).


# Notes #

I am a notorious note taker and throughout my education people have often asked
me for notes, so I decided to upload all notes I take (that are somewhat good
and consistent) and share with the world. Currently they are shared through my
ownCloud installation and can be found
[here](https://wirsenius.se:1339/index.php/s/aHfPK1Gp3xA3YdU).  Note that my
installation uses HTTPS but lacks a valid SSL certificate. (I know, it really
shouldn't, but I haven't gotten around to fix that.) Regardless, enjoy the
notes.

# Posts #

I used to work as a junior journalist and I blogged for almost 10 years. If I
feel the urge to write something down (most likely it will be something nerdy
about computers or it might just be photos), you'll find it below.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
