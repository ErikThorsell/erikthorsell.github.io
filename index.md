In order to win the marketplace, your company must deliver higher quality software -- *faster*.
I emphasize *faster*, because if you make speed your highest priority, you will see benefits in all parts of your
organization.

I believe we achieve this by enabling developers to take complete ownership of the service or product they are
expected to deliver.
This will start a positive feedback loop where teams feel more confident experimenting, releasing new features, and
taking accountability for their deliverables.

Unfortunately, the reality for many companies today is the opposite.
Their portfolio consists of software bogged down with technical debt, which leads to lower quality deliveries, that
gets released at an ever decreasing pace; because no one feels confident that the next release will actually work as
expected.
In today's competitive market, this will ultimately lead to higher turnover rates and difficulty recruiting new talent.

*You will lose the marketplace.*

I believe we break the downward spiral by looking at *both*: (1) your organization and how you divide work between your
teams, as well as (2) your software architecture, tech stack, and tools.
If you want to learn more about how I use tools from the DevOps toolbox to help organizations and teams shorten their
lead time and increase their revenue, get in touch and let's [discuss how we can work together](/work-with-me/).
