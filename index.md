# An Introduction #

My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resume as a point of contact between you and me.
In a couple of months I will have spent 19 consecutive years in school. I have
studied music and performance, leadership, and I soon have a B.Sc., an M.Sc. and
an M.Sc.Eng. in computer science. In addition to my broad education I have
worked summer - and part time - jobs along side my studies. Journalism at my
home town news paper, go-kart track manager, software developer at NASA, machine
learning engineer at a start up; I have tried a lot. I am a curious guy and I
really like to learn new things. Over the years I have become very disciplined
and have developed an analytical mind set which has proven very useful, both in
my engineering studies and my work life.

# Current Status #

I have spent the past two years studying machine learning, AI, and optimization.
At the moment, I am writing my master's thesis in collaboration with Volvo Cars.
The objective of the thesis is to investigate the potential of using machine
learning (more specifically: different recurrent neural network techniques) to
perform online route pattern predictions in Volvo Cars' vehicles. If the thesis
proves successful in discovering, and implementing, said techniques it could be
used to reduce energy consumption (and increase regenerative opportunities) in
Volvo Cars' vehicles in general and their EVs/PHEVs in particular.


# Coming Up #

Come June and I will have graduated. I am a very social guy and even though I
have spent a fair amount time doing software development, I am not interested in
a job that locks me up with a keyboard. I am a problem solver at heart and love
to come up with solutions to complex problems. If you are looking for your next
.NET/Java developer, I am not your guy. However, if your company (or your
customer) is looking for someone to help them: find correlations in purchase
histories or understand what machine learning/deep learning/AI is and what it
can be used for, and they also need someone who is capable of presenting the
findings for the entire leadership of the company without loosing it, I am that
guy. I want to work with data and I want to work with people. I have an interest
in machine learning, data analysis, business intelligence, solution engineering,
and last but not least: education. If your opportunity entails teaching someone
something, that is not an issue, I like that.

I am motivated by challenges, and if engineering school has taught me anything
it is that I can learn anything given the time. With 37 university courses in my
backpack I am confident in saying that learning is second nature to me, and I
want to keep learning. Regardless of the job I want to find new approaches,
learn new techniques, discover new subjects, and widen my area of expertise.

Hopefully I have given a clear picture of who I am and what I want. If you have
additional questions do not hesitate to contact me. Send me a PM here on
LinkedIn or send me an email at erik@thorsell.cc. I am looking forward to hear
from you and listen to what problems you have!
