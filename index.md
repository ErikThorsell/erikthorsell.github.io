# An Introduction #

My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resume as a point of contact between you and me.
In a couple of months I will have spent 19 consecutive years in school.
I have studied music and performance, leadership, and I soon have a B.Sc., an
M.Sc. and an M.Sc.Eng. in computer science.
In addition to my broad education I have worked summer - and part time - jobs
along side my studies:
Journalist at my home town news paper, go-kart track manager, software developer
at NASA, machine learning engineer at a start up; I have tried a lot.
I am a curious guy and I really like to learn new things.
Check out [my resume]({{site.url}}/download/erikthorsell_cv.pdf), [work
page]({{site.url}}/work), and [LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorsellerik/) if you want to read more
about what I have done.

Over the years I have become
very disciplined and have developed an analytical mind set which has proven very
useful, both in my engineering studies and my work life.
I am motivated by challenges and if engineering school has taught me anything
it is that I can learn *anything* given the time.
With 37 university courses in my backpack, I am confident in saying that
learning is second nature to me, and I want to keep learning.
I want to find new approaches, learn new techniques, discover new subjects, and
widen my area of expertise.


# Current Status #

I have spent the past two years studying machine learning, AI, and optimization.
At the moment, I am writing my master's thesis in collaboration with Volvo Cars.
The objective of the thesis is to investigate the potential of using machine
learning (more specifically: different recurrent neural network techniques) to
perform online route pattern predictions in Volvo Cars' vehicles.
If the thesis proves successful in discovering, and implementing, said
techniques it could be used to reduce energy consumption (and increase
regenerative opportunities) in Volvo Cars' vehicles in general and their
EVs/PHEVs in particular.


# Coming Up #

My plan is to graduate late May/early June and after a short (but well deserved)
vacation I will join [HiQ Gothenburg](https://www.hiq.se/en/) as a full time
consultant.
My first mission will take place at Volvo Group Trucks Technology where I will
be part of a new team focused on developing automated trucks, buses and other
industrial vehicles.

Hopefully I have given a clear picture of who I am and what I want. If you have
additional questions do not hesitate to contact me.
Send me a PM on LinkedIn or an email at
[erik@thorsell.cc](mailto:erik@thorsell.cc).
I am looking forward to hear from you and listen to what problems you have!
