*My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resume as a point of contact between you and me.*

*I also wanted a place to host [my tick list]({{site.url}}/ticklist)...*

# An Introduction #

I am approaching 30 and have been married for a little bit more than a year (as
of October 2019). My wife and I are currently living in Gothenburg, Sweden,
where I work as a consultant at [HiQ Gothenburg](https://www.hiq.se/en/). At HiQ
I work partly as a business area developer for our CI/CDD and AI/ML areas, and
partly as a DevOps engineer at Ericsson. 


# Academic and Work background #

I graduated from Chalmers University of Technology during the spring of 2018,
after 19 consecutive years in school.
After studying music, performance, and leadership I now also hold a B.Sc., an
M.Sc. and an M.Sc.Eng. in computer science.
I wrote [my B.Sc.
thesis](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/244534-automatised-analysis-of-emergency-calls-using-natural-language-processing)
on the topic of natural language processing (NLP) and [my M.Sc.
thesis](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/255285-vehicle-speed-profile-prediction-without-spatial-information)
on the applicability of recurrent neural networks for making time-series
predictions.

Work wise I have been working part time with machine learning related topics
since 2016. After graduating I have, however, been focusing mostly on CI/CDD,
agile processes in general, and DevOps development in particular. For my first
assignment as a consultant --- at HiQ Gothenburg --- I developed the Java-CI/CDD
workflow for Volvo GTT Vehicle Automation. After handing that system over, to a
newly formed VA CI/CDD team, I moved on to develop a new product at Ericsson
called Software Delivery Pipeline; a CDD tool for continuously deploying and
monitoring all Ericsson products. I have been part of this project since its
beginning in the spring of 2019.

I am a curious guy and I really like to learn new things.
