*My name is Erik Thorsell and I created this site to have something to put on my
resume as a point of contact between you and me.*

*I also wanted a place to host [my tick list]({{site.url}}/ticklist)...*

# An Introduction #

I graduated from Chalmers University of Technology during the spring of 2018,
after 19 consecutive years in school.
After studying music, performance, and leadership I now also hold a B.Sc., an
M.Sc. and an M.Sc.Eng. in computer science.
I wrote [my B.Sc.
thesis](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/244534-automatised-analysis-of-emergency-calls-using-natural-language-processing)
on the topic of natural language processing (NLP) and my M.Sc. thesis *(yet to
be published)* on the applicability of recurrent neural networks for making
time-series predictions.
I am a curious guy and I really like to learn new things.
Check out [my resume]({{site.url}}/download/erikthorsell_cv.pdf), [work
page]({{site.url}}/work), and [LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorsellerik/) if you want to read more
about what I have done.

Over the years I have become very disciplined and have developed an analytical
mind set which has proven very useful, both in my engineering studies and my
work life.
I am motivated by challenges and if engineering school has taught me anything
it is that I can learn *anything* given the time.
I want to find new approaches, learn new techniques, discover new subjects, and
widen my area of expertise.


# Current Status #

I am currently employed by [HiQ Gothenburg](https://www.hiq.se/en/), helping
Volvo Groups Truck Technology take the next step within vehicle automation.
My expertise concerns machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization,
and software development.

I am looking forward to hear from you and listen to what problems you have!*
