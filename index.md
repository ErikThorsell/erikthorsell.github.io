There are a lot of things in life that I really appreciate: my wife, making
fires, rock climbing, trail running, solving difficult problems, and just
hanging out with awesome people.
At the moment, I am grateful that I am able to combine all of these things in
the hotchpotch that I get to call life.

When I don't work, I spend a lot of time outdoors.  Sorted by frequency: I
[run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48967952), I
[climb](https://youtu.be/aX2q-5WvtEE?list=TLPQMTAwNTIwMjB3pLfqNJL8aw), and I
[make fires](https://wirsenius.se/index.php/f/12183069)\*.
The running and fire making are solely for fun, but I am a certified Swedish
Climbing Federation *help* instructor, meaning that I am actually somewhat
knowledgable and serious about the climbing stuff!
I also enjoy hiking, which intersects well with my love for coffee.
Nothing beats a steeped cup of coffee from a pot warmed by the camp fire.

*\* The climbing and fire making occurr quite infrequently nowadays, so the list
might be incorrectly sorted...*

I am a curious guy and I really like to learn new things.
