In order to win the marketplace, your company must deliver higher quality software -- *faster*.

The emphasis on *faster* is crucial, because if you make the speed at which you deliver your product your highest
priority, you will have to scrutinize all parts of your organization.
No other key performance indicator will force you to understand your planning, development, testing, deployment and
support processes like _speed_.

I believe we achieve high speed by enabling developers to take complete ownership of the service or product they are
expected to deliver.
This will start a positive feedback loop where teams feel more confident experimenting, releasing new features, and
taking accountability for their deliverables.

I believe in the DevOps principles.

<!-- 
Unfortunately, the reality for many companies today is the opposite.
Their portfolio consists of software bogged down with technical debt, which leads to lower quality deliveries, that
gets released at an ever decreasing pace; because no one feels confident that the next release will actually work as
expected.
In today's competitive market, this will ultimately lead to higher turnover rates and difficulty recruiting new talent.

*You will lose the marketplace.*

I believe we break the downward spiral by looking at *both*: (1) your organization and how you divide work between your
teams, as well as (2) your software architecture, tech stack, and tools.
