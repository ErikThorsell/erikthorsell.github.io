*A short summary*

### Education

I graduated from Chalmers University of Technology during the spring of 2018,
after 19 consecutive years in school. I spent three years studying music and
performance, another year studying theological leadership, and I now also hold a
B.Sc., an M.Sc. and an M.Sc.Eng.  in computer science.  I wrote [my B.Sc.
thesis](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/244534-automatised-analysis-of-emergency-calls-using-natural-language-processing)
on the topic of natural language processing (NLP) and [my M.Sc.
thesis](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/255285-vehicle-speed-profile-prediction-without-spatial-information)
on the applicability of recurrent neural networks for making time-series
predictions.

### Work

During my master studies, I worked part time with machine learning related
areas, first for [NEVS](https://www.nevs.com/en/) and therafter for 
[MIS](http://machineintelligence.se/).
After graduation I worked as a consultant at
[HiQ Gothenburg](https://www.hiq.se/en/jobs/gothenburg/), where I focused
on the technical implementation of CI/CDD (Continuous Integration, Delivery &
Deployment) first at Volvo Group Vehicle Automation and thereafter at Ericsson.
During my time at HiQ, I was also the *Business Area Developer* for HiQ's
business areas: CI/CDD and ML/AI.

Today, I focus predominantly on leadership, as a Team Facilitator at Ericsson.
The goal of the Team Facilitator is to create
[high-performance teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_teams),
and my daily work revolves around coaching my colleagues to become more
efficient and increase their team's [velocity](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/velocity/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'velocity))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)).
I facilitate three development teams (two in Sweden, one in China).
