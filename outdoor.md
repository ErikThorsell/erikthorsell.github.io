Outdoor
===

As mentioned on [the landing page]({{site.url}}), I like to do things outdoors.
On this page, I have taken the opportunity to write a little bit about the
outdoor activities I like üòÅ

# Trail Running
During the Christmas holiday of 2019, my father in law and myself started talking about
running.
I don't remember the details of the discussion, but I do remember the gist: I should
probably do some sort of aerobic training, if I want to be in reasonable shape when I
reach 50.
Outcome: I was going to pick up running.

Historically, I had tried running every once in a while -- often in combination with a diet,
weight training, or some other activity -- but always hated it.
This time, it would be different.

Firstly, I tried to identify where my hatred for running came from.
It was quite easy to figure out: What I had always hated with running was the feeling of
exhaustion.
It sucks to taste blood and heave ones chest for air.
During my previous attempts at *getting into running*, I had always felt that it was
my lunges that was my weak point, not my legs.
Solution?
I started running slower than my max.
When I came back from an hour long run, I actually felt OK.
I never sprinted, never tried to max out, I just jogged along -- and it felt nice.

Secondly, I like the woods.
Previously, I had always run on the road -- usually around a couple of blocks close to
where I live.
I thought that: *"If I'm going to like running, I better run somewhere I like to be."*,
so I set out for the woods.
Luckily, I live only a couple of hundreds of meters from a nature reserve, so that became
my goto running spot.

The number of trails are plenty, and I still find new trails:

# Hiking

Hiking is how I rediscovered my love for the woods and wilderness.
As a child, I spent a lot of time out and about.
Then came video games, higher education, other interests, etc. and I pretty much
stopped spending time in non urban areas.

Hiking is also an interest I share with my wife.
Thusfar, we have taken a handful of nice hikes together.
The images below are from Laugavegur, Iceland, and Bergslagsleden, Sweden, respectively.

# Climbing
I used to climb, a lot, but nowadays I mostly look at old movies or read about
my past accomplishments.

Consider reading my [tick list]({{site.url}}/ticklist), or watch a video on my
climbing dedicated [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi9p-FX7qLCEXbyfLISFtHg/).
