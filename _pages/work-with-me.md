My goal is to help organisations better understand and embrace the power of
iterative improvements.
I have a large interest in automation and feedback, and how these concepts
can be applied to increase revenue in software development companies.

I'm convinced that companies which strive to automate as much of their software
lifecycle as possible as well as are attentive to their customers' needs, will
deliver higher quality software at a faster pace.
I can help your organisation achieve this.

## My background

My career started with software development and I still write code on a daily basis.
However, it's not much Java SpringBoot any more.
Instead, I write code to automate processes (Python and Bash) and codify
infrastructure (Terraform, Packer as well as
Ansible).

After a couple of years as a developer, my career pivoted towards leadership.
I have worked as a Scrum Master and a Team Facilitator, where I have helped
teams find *their* best way of working.
I also spent six months as acting Line Manager at Ericsson.

## My offering

My two biggest strengths are that I have done a little bit of everything and
that I always strive to improve.
I understand management's point of view, sale's, operation's as well as the developers'.
All parts of the organisation usually want to achieve similar things: Remove hurdles,
increase speed, shorten the feedback loop, get better results, increase profit; but
they see different ways there.
Together, we find a common way.

Today, I lead a small consultancy: Request for Coffee.
RFC focus on _everything DevOps_, be it strategic or practical, with a strong
focus on combining technical know how with leadership and management skills to
help organisations deliver software faster.
I call myself a `DevOps Transformation Leader` and I believe that DevOps will do
to software development what Lean did to manufacturing.

Let's transform your organisation, together.
