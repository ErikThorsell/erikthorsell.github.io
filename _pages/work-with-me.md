If you succeed to give your developers the platform, tools, and space they need to be creative, they will deliver
higher quality software at a faster pace.
I can help your organisation achieve this.

## My background

My career started with software development and I still write code on a daily basis.
However, it's not much Java SpringBoot any more.
Instead, I write code to automate processes (Python and Bash) and codify infrastructure (Terraform, Packer as well as
Ansible).

After a couple of years as a developer, my career pivoted towards leadership.
I have worked as a Scrum Master and a Team Facilitator, where I have helped teams find *their* best way of working.
I also spent six months as acting Line Manager at Ericsson and even though it was not the most fun six months of my
career it taught me invaluable lessons about multi-team and organisational leadership.

## My offering

My two biggest strengths are that I have done a little bit of everything and that I always strive to improve.
I understand management's point of view, sale's, operation's as well as the developers'.
All parts of the organisation usually want to achieve similar things: Remove hurdles, increase speed, shorten the
feedback loop, get better results, increase profit; but they see different ways there.
Together, we find a common way.

Today, I lead a small consultancy: Request for Coffee.
RFC focus on _everything DevOps_, be it strategic or practical, with a strong focus on combining technical know how with
leadership and management skills to help organisations deliver software faster.
I call myself a `DevOps Transformation Leader` and I believe that DevOps will do to software development what Lean
did to manufacturing.

Let's transform your organisation, together.
