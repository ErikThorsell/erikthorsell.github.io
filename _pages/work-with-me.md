I'm convinced that companies which strive to automate as much of their software
lifecycle as possible and are attentive to their customers' needs, will
deliver higher quality software at a faster pace.
I can help your organisation achieve this.

## My background

I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc.Eng in Computer Science as well as a M.Sc. in
Computer Science, Algorithms, Languages and Logic -- all from Chalmers
University of Technology.
I concentrated my masters studies to machine learning, artificial intelligence
and optimisation and wrote both my theses on machine learning topics[^ml-resume].

Post graduating I worked as a software developer but quickly understood that
my interest is predominantly in _what_ and _why_ we write certain code, not
necessarily _how_.
Therefore, the trajectory of my career has taken me through roles like _Scrum
Master_, _Team Facilitator_ and _Line Manager_ until I eventually found my
preferred way of working as a consultant.

## My offering

Today, I lead a small consultancy company: [Request for
Coffee](https://requestforcoffee.dev), through which I focus on _everything
DevOps_, be it strategic or practical.
I call myself a `DevOps Transformation Leader` and I really believe that the
methods that have been rejuvenated by the DevOps boom can do to software
development what Lean did to manufacturing.

I'm a developer -- sort of -- but the code I write is not the kind that makes
its way into an app on your phone, an embedded device in your car, or onto a
webpage.
Instead, I write code which helps the people developing those things do a better
job.
I automate processes and write pipelines, using Python and Bash, and I codify
infrastructure using tools like Terraform, CDK and Ansible.
My favourite thing is to create and setup tools for other developers to
use[^platform] and then teach the importance of these tools and how they can be
used to make better decisions about what to develop next.

I'm also a teacher, presenter, leader and coach -- sort of.
I have chosen the consultancy road and consultancy assignments aren't meant
to last forever.
(My preferred assignment length is more like a year or two.)
When my assignment comes to an end, I will have failed if your organisation
cannot continue to reap the benefits of the work we have accomplished together.
If our paths cross again, I want to hear about how you were able to build on
top of what we built together and how you have been continuously improving
ever since.
