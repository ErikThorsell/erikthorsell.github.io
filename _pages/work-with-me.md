DevOps is speed, which is achievable when your operations department enables the development department to take
complete ownership of their services.

If you succeed to give your developers the platform, tools, and space they need to be creative, they will deliver
higher quality software at a faster pace.
I can help your organization achieve this.

## Why am I successful at what I offer?

My two biggest strengths are that I have done a little bit of everything and always strive to find new processes to
streamline.
The goal is always the same: Remove hurdles, increase speed, get better results.

My career started with software development and I still write code on a daily basis.
However, it's not much Java SpringBoot anymore, but rather scripts for automating different steps in a product's
value stream.
Every so often I need to get waist deep in some actual application in order to understand how I can best help the
team developing it, but I mostly focus on meta-programming[^meta-programming].

After a couple of years as a developer, my career pivoted towards leadership.
I have worked as a Scrum Master and a Team Facilitator, where I have helped teams find *their* best way of working.
I also spent six months as Acting Line Manager at Ericsson.
This taught me that I never want to become a manager again, but I also learned invaluable lessons about multi-team and
organizational leadership, that I had not picked up from my time as a Team Facilitator.

Now, I combine my technical knowhow with my leadership and management skills to help organizations deliver software
faster.
I draw inspiration from the DevOps movement because I believe that DevOps will do to software development what Lean did
to manufacturing.
