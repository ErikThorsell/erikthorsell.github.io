I see myself as a person who implement DevOps.
I am not a Software Developer nor an IT Operations Engineer.
This means that I do not have the ambition to know everything about a certain
(or several) programming language(s).
It also means that I will never be the most knowledgeable when it comes to
infrastructure as code implementations.

What I *do* have is the following:

* a broad understanding of various technologies;
* experience designing and implementing continuous integration and deployment pipelines;
* an eagerness to ensure the teams and companies I work with deliver at the top
  of their ability;
* people and leadership skills;
* an agile mindset and background facilitating several XFTs;
* a good understanding of DevOps, as defined by [Kim et al.][devops-handbook];

I want to work with companies that have decided that DevOps is the way to go,
but maybe don't know how to implement the processes that DevOps stipulates.
I can assist you in all aspects of "implementing DevOps", be it communication
with stakeholders or between departments, or getting my hands dirty and help
out implementing better versioning, continuous integration/deployment
pipelines, application monitoring, etc.

I also gladly work with companies well on their DevOps journey, who need an
experienced Scrum Master/Team Facilitator/Agile Coach to help new/junior teams.
In such a role, I want to be _part_ of a team and spend part of my time
contributing to the team's daily work.
This ensures I have a good understanding of the team's impediments and stay
relevant.

The easiest way to reach me is via [email](mailto:erik@thorsell.io), but feel
free to use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorsellerik/) if you prefer.
