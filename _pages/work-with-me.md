If you succeed to give your developers the platform, tools, and space they need to be creative, they will deliver
higher quality software at a faster pace.
I can help your organization achieve this.

## My background

My two biggest strengths are that I have done a little bit of everything and always strive to find new processes to
streamline.
The goal is always the same: Remove hurdles, increase speed, get better results.

My career started with software development and I still write code on a daily basis.
However, it's not much Java SpringBoot anymore, but rather scripts for automating different steps in a product's
value stream.
Every so often I need to get waist deep in some actual application in order to understand how I can best help the
team developing it, but I mostly focus on meta-programming[^meta-programming].

After a couple of years as a developer, my career pivoted towards leadership.
I have worked as a Scrum Master and a Team Facilitator, where I have helped teams find *their* best way of working.
I also spent six months as Acting Line Manager at Ericsson.
This taught me that I never want to become a manager again, but I also learned invaluable lessons about multi-team and
organizational leadership.

## My offering

Now, I combine my technical knowhow with my leadership and management skills to help organizations deliver software
faster.
I call myself a `DevOps Transformation Leader` and I believe that DevOps will do to software development what Lean
did to manufacturing.

Let's transform your organization, together.
