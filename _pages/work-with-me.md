*I help teams increase their throughput and organizations improve the quality
of their software deliveries.* 

Despite having experience with all of the following, I do not want to label
myself.
I am not a developer, an architect, a coach, nor a manager.
When we work together, I want you to ignore the *role* you think you need and
focus on what problems your organization are facing and how we can collaborate
to overcome them.
If you strictly want a `[insert very specific job role here]` there's likely
a better fit for you out there.
But if you need a flexible person, who can help you assess your current
situation and contribute in multiple ways to take your organization closer to
delivering higher quality products in a less stressful way, I urge you to
continue reading. 
<!--
If I need to get hands on as a keyboard warrior I will rise to the occasion.
If your organization needs help understanding best practices and agile ways of
working I have loads of experience to bring.
If you need help redesigning your application's architecture, or you're starting
from scratch, I can help you navigate your way towards a suitable solution for
*your* product.
On top of all of this, I always maintain my "think about the humans working
with us" mentality that I have nurtured during my time as Team Facilitator and
Line Manager.

My Modus Operandi is to use the most suitable tool for a particular issue.
More often than not, the tool originates from the Agile or the DevOps movements,
and -- as I am allergic to the *not invented here* mentality -- I strive to
stand on the shoulders of giants and reuse battle tested concepts as opposed to
reinventing the wheel.

For the most up-to-date info, please consult [my resumé][resume], but shortly;
I have:

* technical knowhow and experience with software development;
* worked with different software stacks and tools to implement and maintain
  testing, integration & delivery pipelines;
* led Cross Functional Teams (XFTs) using Scrum, Kanban & SAFE, and coached
  the team members in Agile and DevOps principles;
* experience as a manager and understand what it means to lead a large
  organization;
* a good understanding of DevOps, as defined by [Kim et al.][devops-handbook].
