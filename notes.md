# Notes #

## Currently unavailable ##

I caught the [Intel Atom C2000 bug](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/06/cisco_intel_decline_to_link_product_warning_to_faulty_chip/)
and setting up my Nextcloud installation is on my todo-list, albeit not the top
priority.
Hence, it might take a while until the notes appear here again.

[//]: # (me for notes, so I decided to upload all notes I take and share with the world.)
[//]: # (Currently they are shared through my Nextcloud installation and can be found)
