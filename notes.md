# Notes #

I am a notorious note taker and throughout my education people have often asked
me for notes, so I decided to upload all notes I take and share with the world.
The notes below are left as is and you should take into consideration that:

 1. I might have gotten something wrong.
 2. The course might have changed since I took it.
 3. My handwriting is not excellent.
