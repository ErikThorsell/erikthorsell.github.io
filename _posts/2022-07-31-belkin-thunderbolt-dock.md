title: Belkin Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock
---

In order to remedy the situation with the faulty USB-hubs in the various monitors I have tested, I bought a
[Belkin Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock](https://www.belkin.com/in/docks-hubs/connect-pro-thunderbolt-4-dock/p/p-inc006/).
It can do 5k2k @ 75Hz which is what I need for my day to day use, but it's a shame that I had to purchase such an
expensive docking station _on top of_ an expensive monitor.

Nevertheless, the dock has served me really well for the past couple of weeks and if you have the money I'd recommend
the Dell U4021QW together with the dock.
All in all, the Dell _is_ a nicer monitor than the Lenovo.
