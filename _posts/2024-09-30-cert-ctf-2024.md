# Start

First thing I did was to check for anything readable in the provided `.pcap`:

```
strings CERT-SE_CTF2024.pcap | less
```

and I quickly found an IRC conversation!
Super fun, especially since I use IRC on a daily basis.
I noticed that the IRC conversation was between two users (`An4lys3r` and `D3f3nd3r`) and by filtering the output based
on users' IPs I was able to get something quite readable.

# Extracting the IRC conversation

```
strings CERT-SE_CTF2024.pcap | grep '@10.0.0.' | less
```

```

# Flag in IRC conversation

Looking at the IRC conversation above, the first flag was right there.

Flag 1: `CTF[E65D46AD10F92508F500944B53168930]`


# Flag in `.pcap`

While using `strings` I tried to just grep for more flags:

```
$> strings ../CERT-SE_CTF2024.pcap | grep 'CTF\['
7PASS CTF[AES128]
!PASS CTF[AES128]
W_PRIVMSG #emergency :He also handed over a strange looking string CTF[E65D46AD10F92508F500944B53168930], does it make sense to you?
r:D3f3nd3r!~user1@10.0.0.20 PRIVMSG #emergency :He also handed over a strange looking string CTF[E65D46AD10F92508F500944B53168930], does it make sense to you?
```

Idk if this is too obvious, but the instructions from Cert say flags should have the format `CTF[...]`, so...

Flag 2: `CTF[AES128]`


# RANSOME_NOTE.gz (DCC)

In their IRC conversation, the users talk about a file `RANSOM_NOTE.gz` which they have apparently received from the
hackers.
For some reason they opted to send this using [DCC](https://modern.ircdocs.horse/dcc#dcc-send) instead of using the
FTP-server they'll be using throughout the rest of their conversation :p

By grepping for `DCC` in the .pcap I was able to find the initialisation message:

```
DCC SEND RANSOM_NOTE.gz 167772170 40899 95285 221
```

The above contains the integer representation of the IP address (`167772170` -> `10.0.0.10`) and the port being used
for the transfer (`40899`).
The documentation does not mention the last two numbers that is part of the message, but I presume they are the size of
the transfer (`95285`) and maybe the block size used(?).

I opened up Wireshark and filtered accordingly:

```
ip.addr == 10.0.0.10 && tcp.port == 40899
```

whereafter I right-clicked on the first package in the list, chose `Follow` -> `TCP Stream`, made sure to go to the
bottom left of the dialogue and choose only one side of the conversation (the one that is 95kB), choose _Show data as
`Raw`_ and then save the data to a file called `RANSOM_NOTE.gz`.

The IRC conversation kindly contains the `sha256sum` for the ransom note and I was able to verify that my file had the
same hash: `7113f236b43d1672d881c6993a8a582691ed4beb4c7d49befbceb1fddfb14909`.

After decompressing the file:

```
gunzip RANSOM_NOTE.gz
```

I got a `279943 byte` large text file, starting like this:

```
CCCCCCCCCCCTCCCCCFCCCCC[CCCCCOCCCCCRCCCCTCCCCCTTCCCCTFCCCCT[CCCCTOCCCCTRCCCCFCCCCCFTCCCCFFCCCCF[CCCCFOCCCCFRCCCC[CCCCC[TCCCC[FCCCC[[CCCC
```

_Here, I'm a litte bit stuck._


# FTP Files in original .pcap

In the IRC conversation we can see multiple references to files being uploaded to an FTP server.
By filtering on `ftp` in Wireshark we can practically follow the progress of all of these files (gotta love encryption,
right?).

_I show the entire communication for file 1, below, but for the other files I have only included the relevant parts._

```

```

The approach for fetching the content of each file is the same:

1. Find the IP:port being used, which in this case is `10.0.0.20` followed by `<first integer> * 256 + <second
   integer>`.
   For the first file the port is: `143 * 256 + 63 = 36 671`.

2. Use Wireshark the same way we got the DCC file:
   * Follow
   * TCP Stream
   * Choose one side of the communication
   * Save Raw data


# corp_net1.pcap (from FTP in original .pcap)

I used the same approach for this `.pcap` as I did for the first one: `strings`.
After quickly scanning through the file I noticed more FTP traffic.
More specifically, this (truncated):

```
$> tshark -r corp_net1.pcap -Y "ftp" -T fields -e _ws.col.Info

Request: SIZE puzzle.exe
Request: PORT 192,168,137,28,136,69

Request: SIZE Recycle-Bin.zip
Request: PORT 192,168,137,28,199,239

Request: SIZE archive
Request: PORT 192,168,137,28,206,7
```

As before, I retrieved the files by following the TCP Streams.

# Flag in puzzle.exe (from FTP in corp_net1.pcap)

A natural approach here would be to execute the program, but I don't own a Windows PC....

Instead, the first thing I tried was to `hexdump` the file.
The last segment of the dump showed this:

```
01239050  2e 2e 77 2e 2e 2e 3f 2e  2e 2e 37 2e 2e 2e 2e 38  |..w...?...7....8|

*
012390a0
```

and 

```
$> strings your_program.exe | grep -i pyinstaller

._pyi_main_co....Traceback is disabled via bootloader option.....PYINSTALLER_RESET_ENVIRONMENT...1......._PYI_ARCHIVE_FILE......._PYI_APPLICATION_HOME_DIR......._PYI_PARENT_PROCESS_LEVEL......._PYI_SPLASH_IPC.0.......Invalid value in _PYI_PARENT_PROCESS_LEVEL: %s

.....Could not side-load PyInstaller's PKG archive from external file (%s)
.._pyinstaller_pyz........PYZ archive entry not found in the TOC!
```

indicates that the `.exe` was created using PyInstaller.

I tried [pyinstxtractor.py](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) but it throws the error:

```
[+] Processing puzzle.exe
[!] Error : Missing cookie, unsupported pyinstaller version or not a pyinstaller archive]
```

and my conclusion is that pyinstxtractor.py does not support Python 3.12 (which seems to be the version used for the
`.exe`).

---

Second thing I tried was actually starting the `.exe` in Wine.
That did not work, so I tried dosbox.
That did not work either...

---

Third thing was to enlist a friend with a Windows computer!
He was able to start the application and found that it's a puzzle game (who would've thought...).
If you do enough of the puzzle the flag can be read of the screen.

Flag 3: `CTF[HAPPYBIRTHDAY]` (_potentially with a space between `Y` and `B`_)


# Recycle-Bin.zip (from FTP in corp_net1.pcap)

I started with the obvious:

```
$> unzip Recycle-Bin.zip 
Archive:  Recycle-Bin.zip
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of Recycle-Bin.zip or
        Recycle-Bin.zip.zip, and cannot find Recycle-Bin.zip.ZIP, period.
```

I tried repairing the archive:

```
$> zip -FF Recycle-Bin.zip --out Recycle-Bin-fixed.zip && unzip Recycle-Bin-fixed.zip
```

which yielded a new directory: `C` in which I could find some stuff:

```
C/$Recycle.Bin/S-1-5-21-2433278764-4034921937-2507072421-1164 $> ll

'$I1QVT66.txt'
'$I27B4VA.txt'
'$I283B2L.txt'
'$I2UBK07.jpg'
-- and much more --
```

I wrote a simple script to check whether any flags were hiding in plain sight:

```
find . -type f | while read -r file; do
    grep -Eo 'CTF' "$file" && echo "Found in: $file"
done
```

but was unable to find anything.

Then I wrote another script to check the output of `file` for each file.
The output is summarised below:

```
-- the majority of files were identified as Matlab files --
$I0BN3IA.pdf Matlab v4 mat-file (little endian) \330\367\332\0018, sparse, rows 0, columns 17051
$IZQJF50.txt Matlab v4 mat-file (little endian) \326\367\332\001=, sparse, rows 0, columns 4
...

-- second most common file type was ASCII or ASCII with CRLF line terminators -- 
$R0G1V6C.txt ASCII text
$R0P8KGD.txt ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
...

-- then I found some images and some other files --

$RCXHUFJ.zip Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate

$RGRASUC.pdf PDF document, version 1.7, 1 pages (zip deflate encoded)
$RJLEGV5.pdf PDF document, version 1.7, 1 pages (zip deflate encoded)
```

The `.pdf` files listed above all contained a lorem ipsum paragraph and nothing more.

The images were hand drawn images of cats and dogs (and one image just had CAT written by hand in it).

Both powershell scripts only contained: `Write-Host "Räkna ut din riktiga ålder"`

The zip archive contained a `NewFileTime.txt` with the following content:

```
Server:

https://www.softwareok.de/?Download=NewFileTime
https://www.softwareok.com/?Download=NewFileTime
https://www.softwareok.eu/?Download=NewFileTime

http://www.softwareok.de/?Download=NewFileTime
http://www.softwareok.com/?Download=NewFileTime
http://www.softwareok.eu/?Download=NewFileTime
```

and a `NewFileTime_x64.exe`.

I then checked the content of all files identified as text files.
They mostly contain rubbish, but to give an excerpt, here are a couple:

```
$R0G1V6C.txt

dolore 

--- End of File ---

$R0P8KGD.txt

Jamborino Jamboro Archipelago Island Apple Horse
Monkey Dog
Kit Kat House Flower

--- End of File ---

$R0S90LB.txt

Jamborino Jamboro Archipelago Island Apple Horse
Monkey Dog
Kit Kat House Flower

--- End of File ---

$R1QVT66.txt

esse 

--- End of File ---
```

Maybe this will come in handy later?

# Flag in archive (from FTP in corp_net1.pcap)

According to `file`, `archive` is a gzip compressed archive:

```
$> file archive
archive: gzip compressed data, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 847
```

so I added a `.gz` extension to the file and attempted to unpack it using `gunzip`:

```
$> gunzip archive.gz    
gzip: archive already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? y
```

Out the other end came a new file, which was also a gzip archive.
And then another one.
And another one.

But I kept at it, running my one liner:

```
$> mv archive archive.gz && gunzip archive.gz && file archive && cat archive
```

until finally:

```
$> mv archive archive.gz && gunzip archive.gz && file archive && cat archive
archive: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

_really ?_

After repeating the process of alternating `gunzip` and `tar` I finally was rewarded:

```
$> mv input input.gz && gunzip input.gz && file input && cat input
input: ASCII text
CTF[IRRITATING]
```

Flag 4: `CTF[IRRITATING]`


# corp_net2.pcap (from FTP in original .pcap)

A bunch of TLS traffic.
Haven't investigated this further.


# disk1.img.gz (from FTP in corp_net1.pcap)

```
$> file disk1.img
disk1.img: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0xc, start-CHS (0x0,32,33), end-CHS (0x82,138,8), startsector 2048, 2095104 sectors
```

Let's mount this using the offset calculated as:

```
Offset = Start Sector × Sector Size
       = 2048 × 512 bytes
       = 1,048,576 bytes
```

```
$> sudo mount -o loop,offset=1048576 disk1.img $(pwd)/diskmount

$> ls -la diskmount

$> file diskmount/secret.encrypted 
diskmount/secret.encrypted: openssl enc'd data with salted password
```

I fetched `openssl2john.py` from
[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwall/john/bleeding-jumbo/run/openssl2john.py) and used it to convert the 
encrypted secret to a hash.

```
python openssl2john.py diskmount/secret.encrypted > secret.hash
```

I then downloaded [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) and tried to use the `WORDLIST.txt` we found
earlier to see if we could find a match:

```
$> ./john --wordlist=WORDLIST.txt secret.hash
Loaded 1 password hash (openssl-enc, OpenSSL "enc" encryption [32/64])

Session completed. 
```

But I believe `NATHAN` was a false positive as I was unable to use it for decrypting the `secret.encrypeted` file.

```
$> openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -md sha256 -in diskmount/secret.encrypted -pass pass:NATHAN

```

I also tried adding the pbkdf2 flag:

```
$> openssl enc -d -pbkdf2 -aes-256-cbc -md sha256 -in diskmount/secret.encrypted -pass pass:NATHAN

40572AB1327D0000:error:1C800064:Provider routines:ossl_cipher_unpadblock:bad decrypt:../providers/implementations/ciphers/ciphercommon_block.c:124:
˺4�G�ҹ��8=�%
```

I then skipped wrote a little script that tried all passwords in `WORDLIST.txt` and found several matches (`NICOLE`, `BEAUTIFUL`,
...) but they all turned out to be false positives.

When I tested John the Ripper with `rockyou.txt` I got _thousands_ of false positives and somewhere around here I gave
up for now.

I also tried all passwords in `WORDLIST.txt` (after removing the brackets) in combination with all ciphers and digests
using this script:

```

Success with password: BEAUTIFUL, cipher: aes-128-cbc, digest: sha256
Content of decrypted file:
���70̙�Kt��
��[f�
�W��0jo d�_3
```

Note that the bash script found `BEAUTIFUL` with cipher aes-128-cbc which I sort of take as a hint that I'm on the right
way, because Flag 2 was literally: `CTF[AES128]`.
That has to be a hint?!

```
$> file secret.decrypted 
secret.decrypted: Non-ISO extended-ASCII text
```

I actually tried running _this_ file through the same script (maybe it's double-encrypted?!), but got nothing out of it.


## WORDLIST.txt (from FTP in corp_net1.pcap)

I think it makes sense that this file should be used to decrypt the file in the image mounted above...
