title: Python project template using Poetry
---

Lately, I have come to favor Poetry for both small and larger Python projects.
I also use it extensively at work where it has proven itself really well.
To make it even easier to get up and running with arbitrary Python projects I
have created [a Poetry Template and put it on GitHub](https://github.com/ErikThorsell/poetry_project_template).
