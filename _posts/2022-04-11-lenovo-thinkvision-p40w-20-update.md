title: Lenovo ThinkVision P40w-20 (I'm getting mad)
---

I'm going to keep this one short, because this is the ([first]({% post_url 2022-02-02-dell-u4021qw %}),
[second]({% post_url 2022-02-08-dell-u4021qw-update %}),
[third]({% post_url 2022-03-19-lenovo-thinkvision-p40w-20 %})) fourth post about monitors since I got the Dell U4021QW back
in February.

After two to three weeks of use, the Lenovo P40w-20 monitor started behaving the same way the Dell monitor did.
The built in USB-hub does not work with my mouse, nor my wireless dongle for my Modmic.
Granted that the Dell started miss behaving sooner (more like two weeks than three) and the Lenovo _does_ seem to work
100% OK with my Windows laptop -- I'm so frustrated.
I've switched over to my M1 MacBook Pro for 95% of my day-to-day work so this **sucks**.

Since the Dell monitor had _additional_ issues (e.g. the monitor would not turn on after sleeping the laptop) I still
think the Lenovo is the lesser of two evils, but it's crazy that issues like these are allowed to persist in monitors
costing 20 000 SEK (2 000 USD).

## I concede

I don't think I will find a better monitor than the Lenovo, right now, for this price.
Hence, for the foreseeable future, I will have to connect my mouse to my MacBook using bluetooth, and I need to use the
crappy bluetooth audio profile in my QC35s when taking calls.
Both are mostly nuisances, but real ones.
