title: Remote Work
---

Yesterday, I read the [Accelerate State of DevOps 2022 report][dora-2022].
In the report, one can read the following about how organisations has tackled the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to
in-office, remote, or hybrid work:

> Findings showed that organisations with higher levels of employee flexibility have higher organisational performance
> compared to organisations with more rigid work arrangements.
> These findings provide evidence that giving employees the freedom to modify their work arrangements as needed has
> tangible and direct benefits for an organisation.

I'm a strong proponent of remote work.
Before I graduated, I worked remotely for two different companies, and I have been working fully remote since the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic[^wfh].
Whenever a recruiter reach out to me[^recruiter], I seldom bother asking for more technical information about the role
they are pitching, nor do I really care about the compensation package.
First, I want to know whether the position is remote or not.

My wife is an elementary school teacher and she does not have the luxury of rolling out of bed, get a cup of coffee and
be ready to work in 10 minutes.
If she wakes up and feel under the weather she has 30 minutes (at most) before she must make a decision whether to call
in sick or not.
In order to be effective, she needs to be where the kids are, but I can bring my laptop anywhere and as long as I have
an Internet connection I can do my job.
Sure, I will be a little bit more efficient in my home office than I would be on an uncomfortable chair in my mom's
living room, but when I got my hunting license I _did_ spend two weeks working from that living room, with great
success.

My lovely home office.

# Remote work waste less of my time

I have previously written [a post about intentional vs unintentional time]({% post_url 2022-10-27-time %}).
The number one reason I value working remotely so highly is exactly because of this: the increased flexibility that
comes with remote (and by extension: asynchronous) work makes it possible for me to be more intentional with my time.
Not only my _work_ time, but all of my time.

In my post about unintentional time I wrote:

> But few things frustrates me like wasting time.
> Because wasted work time turns into wasted _free_ time; and I value my free time very, very, highly.

The question then becomes: What constitutes wasted time?
Let me propose a definition:

> Wasted time is the time that your employer does not want to pay for, but it's time you spend because of your employer.

Examples?

Commuting.\\
Idle time between adjacent tasks[^dead-time].\\
**MORE?**

But we must also consider the "opportunity cost" of not being able to use the wasted time for more meaningful things.
Like having to go buy groceries on your way home from work, instead of using 30 minutes between two meetings to do so.
Or not feeling able to make time for a workout because after 2 hours of commuting, 8 hours of work and a 1 hour lunch
break, you just don't have the energy.

<!-- FEET NOTES -->
[^wfh]: I would have loved to work remotely sooner, but neither of my previous employers allowed it.

[^recruiter]: I don't know why, but over the past couple of months the number of recruiters I hear from has increased,
              a lot.

[^unintentional-time]: [My previous post about unintentional time]({% post_url 2022-10-27-time %})

[^dead-time]: In [my previous about unintentional time]({% post_url 2022-10-27-time %}) we called this dead time.
              As mentioned in that post, dead time _is_ wasted time, but it's wasted time that we accept.
