title: Two new projects, learning Svelte
---

Late April, a friend of mine asked the following questions in an IRC Channel:
"Anyone knows where to find info about all Brazilian specialty coffees in Sweden?"
"Not yet", I replied, "but soon!"

The very same friend also mentioned [Svelte][svelte], an (according to the
developers): *"radical new approach to building user interfaces"*.
Svelte's selling feature is a compile step which generate vanilla JavaScript
and minimize the amount of work required by the browser.

At the time of the question, I had never written a web app.
This website is based on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and my only previous
experience with webpages come from various off-the-shelf blogs like
[blogg.se][blogg.se] and [workpress][wordpress], and from using
[Squarespace][squarespace].
But I was up for the challenge and started hacking around!
At the time of writing I have not one -- but two -- Svelte apps up and running! üòÅ

# Kaffefiltret.se

[Kaffefiltret.se][kaffefiltret] is an attempt to aggregate Sweden's selection
of specialty coffee.
The ultimate goal is to create a place where micro roasters can reach more
coffee drinkers, and where coffee drinkers can learn more about what each
micro roaster offers.

# √Ñrdethelgdag.se

During a (virtual) fika at work, a colleague asked: "Is tomorrow a holiday?"
We [my colleagues and I] are frequent users of pages like
[√§rdetfredag.se][√§rdetfredag], so I thought to myself that something similar
is needed for checking whether a day is a holiday.

I give you: [√§rdethelgdag.se][√§rdethelgdag], which at the time of writing this
post (a Sunday), declares that it is indeed a holiday today (but that tomorrow
is a work day).
