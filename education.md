# Education #

Nine years of primary school, three years in art school, one year at a
theological leadership school, one year doing a science year in order to do five
years of engineering studies.
That is 19 years of school, below is a (not so) short summary of what I have
learned and what it has meant to me.

### Primary and Music School ###

After nine years in Primary School, I let my science teacher down by choosing to
study music for three years.
He said that I should do music on the side and focus on getting a STEM
education.
Well, I did not listen, but promised that if I ever got bored of music I'd get a
"real" education.
My primary instrument was vocals and despite what my teacher said I really think
art school has helped me a lot.

I think the most important skill I learned was public speaking.
I am not afraid of holding presentations or pleading my case in front of a lot
of people (hey, I've sung solo and worn theater make up in front of thousands of
people).
Being good at speaking in front of others is such an underrated skill and I
think engineers should spend much more time refining how to *present their
ideas*.
Now it might be the case that a good idea is lost due to poor presentation.

### Leadership education ###

After music school I realised that my artistic skills could only take me so far.
At the time, I was volunteering as a youth leader in my church and I had people
around my that really endorsed my leadership skills.
Hence, I applied to Team Training School West (TTS) and their theological
leadership program.
I spent a year working part time as a youth leader and part time doing theology
studies.
This was a great year, and if music school taught me how to speak and act on
stage in front of strangers, TTS taught me how to speak and act around people
that looked up to me and who I had influence over.

During my year at TTS I did everything from helping the rest of the leadership
plan trips and conferences to partaking in the everyday work with the community.
I was given a lot of freedom during this ear and part from the concrete
leadership training, the most important thing I learned during this year was how
to structure my own work.

### Engineering School ###

After TTS I really wanted to tackle university studies.
The promise to my old science teacher still in mind, I applied to a science year
at Chalmers University of Technology and got accepted.
A science year entails one year of studies where a student who is eligible for
university studies in general, but not STEM studies in particular, can acquire
the necessary math, physics and chemistry knowledge required to be eligible for
STEM as well.

It was not obvious what program I would apply to after I had acquired my new
competence.
Industrial Economy, Civil Engineering and Computer Science was on the top 5
list, but so were law school and journalism.
I came to the realization that would I not pick STEM now, I would forever wonder
what it would have been like to finally study tech; so I picked the program I
thought was most tech -- Computer Science!

#### Bachelors of Science ####

A [B.Sc. in
CSE](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/utbildning/program-pa-grundniva/Sidor/Datateknik.aspx)
at Chalmers entails a lot.
Mathematics, programming, computer science, electric power, physics,
environmental studies, electives and a thesis.
I enjoyed (pretty much) every course!
A course at Chalmers is generally eight weeks and around study week seven I
always though: "I have found what I want to do!".
Some things that I still think were really cool are: VHDL-programming,
modelling, control systems, embedded programming, physics and discrete maths.

My B.Sc. thesis: [Automatised analysis of emergency calls using Natural Language
Processing](https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/244534/244534.pdf)
focused on aiding SOS Alarm (the Swedish emergency call centers) to assess their
operators.
We developed four different ways to classify recorded, transcribed, calls into
"good calls" and "bad calls", giving SOS Alarm a good foundation when doing
evaluations of their operators.

After three years I graduated with a 4.4 / 5 GPA.
I decided to apply to the masters program: Computer Science -- Algorithms,
Languages and Logic, because of the freedom to pick a lot of elective courses
and tailor your education.

#### Masters of Science ####

[CSALL](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Computer-Science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx)
offers a lot of flexibility.
The program has four compulsory courses (Algorithms, Logic, Compilers and a
writing/presentation course).
Additionally, there are 12 profile courses (divided into the four tracks:
Algorithms, Logic, Languages and Security) of which one must pick four.
You do not have to follow a particular track.
Finally, there are four elective courses and your thesis.

Due to the theoretical nature of the CSALL programme, I made an active choice to
stay on a theoretical track for my profile- and elective courses.
I took: [discrete optimization](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/programme-information/Pages/SearchProgram.aspx?course_id=24703&parsergrp=2),
[machine learning](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/programme-information/Pages/SearchProgram.aspx?course_id=24468&parsergrp=2),
[artificial intelligence](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/programme-information/Pages/SearchProgram.aspx?course_id=25601&parsergrp=2),
and
[cryptography](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/programme-information/Pages/SearchProgram.aspx?course_id=24316&parsergrp=2)
as my profile courses, and as my elective courses I read:
[game theory](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/courseinformation/Pages/SearchCourse.aspx?course_id=26630&parsergrp=3),
[artificial neural networks](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/courseinformation/Pages/SearchCourse.aspx?course_id=26842&parsergrp=3),
[deep learning](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/courseinformation/Pages/SearchCourse.aspx?course_id=27098&parsergrp=3),
and
[a course concerning the ethics of future technology](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/courseinformation/Pages/SearchCourse.aspx?course_id=26484&parsergrp=3).

I was intrigued by the evident power of the machine learning techniques I
encountered and opted to dive even deeper into that part of the CSE field.
Hence, my M.Sc. thesis concerns whether it is possible to use machine learning
in general (and recurrent neural networks in particular) to predict the future
speed of a car, as well as the remaining distance of a current route.
The quirk is that said predictions should be done *only* using past information
about driving speed and driven distance. (E.g. I must not use the GPS signal.)
